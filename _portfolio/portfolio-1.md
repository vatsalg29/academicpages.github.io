I have created a character level and a word level neural network to recognize hand-written text. I used 2
datasets for this purpose, EMNIST Dataset for character level recognition and IAM Handwriting
Dataset for word level recognition. The character level model uses a CNN architecture and achieved
an accuracy of 88% . The word level model uses a CNN architecture which feeds into a LSTM layer
and this model achieved an accuracy of 79%. <br/>
