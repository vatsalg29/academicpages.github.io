that they can safely manoeuvre away from them.<br/> [Github](https://github.com/vatsalg29/Safety-device-for-fishing-vessels) <br/>

Currently, small marine vessels lack any safety mechanisms for anticollision with other vessels. This often leads to collision 
of small vessels with huge ships especially during night time when the visibility is close to zero, which is caused due to many
weather conditions like heavy rainfall or atmospheric fog. Very often, fishing vessels tend to turn off their power to conserve
fuel when not needed rendering the conventional safety measures useless.

This calls for cheap, power-efficient and independent anti-collision system which can be easily installed on these fishing 
vessels. The currently available systems have a subsidized price around ₹35000.

We designed a cost effective system that costs around ₹5000 by detecting the power of AIS signals. 

**Note -** We won the bronze medal at the annual *Inter-IIT Tech Meet, 2018* held at IIT Madras for this project representing
IIT Guwahati and competing against 18 other IITs.
