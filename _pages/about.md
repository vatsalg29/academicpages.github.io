I am an incoming analyst at American Express, with a B.Tech from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (IITG) in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. My bachelor thesis was in *Visual Question Answering* and can be found [here](https://vatsalg29.github.io/VQA_Thesis.pdf).

I have a strong sense of urgency, initiative and competitive drive to get things done, with precision and perfection. Adept in Python, I have experience in data analysis and visualization frameworks such as MS Excel and Tableau and DL frameworks such as Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras. I also have coding experience in Java, C++ and C.

My research interests lie in the field of **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**, with an extention to Natural Language Processing. I have work experience in multi-modal Image Understanding, Object Detection and Optical Character Recognition models.

In the summer of 2019, I interned at Biomedical Imaging Algorithms Group, Czech Technical University in Prague under the guidance of Prof. [Jan Kybic](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~kybic/). The topic was to predict breast cancer in histopathology images using deep learning architectures. 
    
Besides research, I worked for 2 years, first year as an organizer, and second year as a Module Head and a Core Team member in the annual Techno-Management fest of IIT Guwahati, Techniche. I was also the Branch Representative of my department at IITG during my junior and senior year.
    
I also love solving puzzles. Although I don't do it that often anymore, please do ping me if you've got one :)
